# Code Review

Review your C++ code to save you days of debugging down the road.

Track down complex concurrency problems in multithreaded and distributed applications.

Fix in advance C++ pitfalls - such as memory management problems, resource lifetime bugs, data races, dangling references, etc. - before they blow up in your production environment.

Apply C++ best practices such as the use of standard algorithms, RAII or compile-time polymorphism.

Promote the use of libraries where they can be beneficial.

Enforce unit testing.
